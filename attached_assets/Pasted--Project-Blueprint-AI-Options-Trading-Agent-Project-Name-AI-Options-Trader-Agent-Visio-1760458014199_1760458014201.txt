💎 Project Blueprint: AI Options Trading Agent
🚀 Project Name

AI Options Trader Agent

🌟 Vision

You want a next-generation, AI-powered options trading platform that:

Integrates with Upstox API for live data and trade execution

Uses AI to learn from paper trades, recognize market patterns, and evolve daily

Suggests high-confidence entry and exit points

Trades with strict rules, risk controls, and limited auto-trades

Is plug-and-play, with zero coding needed for the user

Offers a professional dashboard UI that’s clear, elegant, and data-rich

⚙️ Modes of Operation
1️⃣ Paper Trading Mode (AI Learning Mode)

Default mode for AI learning and testing

Auto-paper-trades the Top 5 gainers and Top 5 losers across:

NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, FINNIFTY, SENSEX

Analyzes ATM, ITM, OTM strikes for each

Takes simulated entries/exits

Logs each trade (reason, confidence, Greeks, OI, volume, etc.)

Improves daily accuracy (goal: 99.9% after 30 days)

Generates PDF & Excel learning summaries

2️⃣ Live Trading Mode (Strict Rules)

User must enable manually (“Enable Live Trading” toggle)

Uses AI signals but trades are user-confirmed

AI checks multiple parameters — only if all are satisfied:

Places 1–2 trades per day max

Uses default stock/index & quantity unless user overrides

Ensures risk limits, spread, liquidity, and OI checks pass

All trades journaled in real time

If AI finds no valid setup → it will skip trades automatically

🧠 AI Decision Engine
🔍 Multi-Parameter Conditions Before Any Trade

Each trade decision passes through these AI checks:

Parameter	Description
Delta (Δ)	Measures directional bias; must exceed threshold (e.g.,
OI Change	Detects strong build-up of positions
Volume Trend	Confirms real market participation
Price Momentum	LTP vs SMA/VWAP
Implied Volatility (IV)	Avoids excessive volatility
Spread Quality	Ask-Bid difference ≤ predefined limit
Liquidity Depth	Checks top 5 bid/ask quantities
Time Window	Only valid between 09:15–15:30 IST
Risk Limit	Ensures no breach of per-trade/day max loss
Confidence Score	Aggregated AI score ≥ 0.6 threshold

✅ If all checks pass → trade allowed
❌ If any check fails → “No Trade” signal generated

🧮 AI Learning System

Learns daily from paper trades

Stores feature-outcome relationships

Adjusts weights (like delta importance, OI importance, etc.)

Maintains a 30-day adaptive learning window

Tracks and visualizes its learning improvement (accuracy curve)

🧾 Reporting & Journaling
🔹 Trade Journal

For each trade (paper or live), save:

Symbol / Strike

Entry & Exit time

Entry & Exit price

Reason & parameters

AI confidence %

Profit/Loss

Risk impact

🔹 Reports

Automatically generate:

Daily PDF report (PnL, accuracy, charts, insights)

Excel sheet (trade logs, metrics, reasons)

Learning curve graph (AI accuracy trend)

All downloadable from the app

⚖️ Risk Management (Optional Toggle)

Default: Enabled

Settings include:

Max loss per trade

Max daily drawdown

Auto stop-loss and take-profit suggestions

Position size = 1 lot by default

When disabled: AI will alert but not restrict

🔐 Authentication

Upstox API login with API Key + Redirect URL

Saves token securely (asks only password next time)

Supports .env file storage for security

In mock mode, app runs with sample data (for testing)

📊 Dashboard Overview (UI)

Time

Action buttons:

[Simulate (Paper)]

[Execute (Live)]

🧠 Prompt Summary (Copy & Paste into Replit Ghostwriter)

“Build a full-stack AI-powered options trading app called AI Options Trader Agent using Python and Streamlit.
The app integrates with Upstox API (mock mode available).
It supports Paper and Live trading modes, has AI-based trade signals using Greeks, OI, IV, and confidence scoring, and follows strict risk controls.
The AI should auto-paper-trade top 5 gainers and losers daily, learn from results, and improve accuracy.
The UI must include charts, option chains, signal cards, journals, reports, and settings — all as per professional trading dashboard standards described above.
The folder structure, backend logic, UI layout, and report generation should exactly match the specifications.”
